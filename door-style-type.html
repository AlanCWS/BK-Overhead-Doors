            <p class="extra-details-info-u-factor">
              is a measurement of how well a garage door insulates and resists
              heat transfer. It represents the amount of heat that can pass through the door over time. A lower U-factor
              means the garage door provides better insulation and is more energy-efficient, helping to keep your garage
              warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.
              This factor is especially important if your garage is attached to your home or if you spend time working
              in
              your garage, as it can impact your energy costs and indoor comfort. Garage doors with materials like
              insulated steel, polyurethane, or polystyrene panels typically have lower
              U-factors

            </summary>
            <p class="extra-details-info-r-factor">
              measures the thermal resistance of a garage door, indicating how well it can resist heat flow and provide
              insulation. A higher R-value means better insulation, which helps keep your garage more comfortable by
              maintaining consistent temperatures and reducing energy costs. When it comes to garage doors, the R-value
              is often determined by the type and thickness of the insulation
              material used, such as polystyrene or polyurethane. Polyurethane-insulated doors typically have higher
              R-values because the foam is denser and fills the door more completely.
